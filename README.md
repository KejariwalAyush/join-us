# CODEX
*Codex* is the official coding community of [Institute of Technical Education and Research](http://www.soa.ac.in/iter)
founded in 2016. We bring in budding coders as well as the experienced ones and give them a platform to mingle, share their knowledge and work on building awesome projects. We also collaborate with coding community around Bhubaneswar to increase the exposure of the members of the club. We largely open source. You can find our work [here](https://github.com/codex-iter).
